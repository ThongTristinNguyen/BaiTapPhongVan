# Analysis of Pros and Cons of Naive Bayes and Deep Learning on MNIST Dataset

## 1. Using Naive Bayes to Train the MNIST Dataset

### Approach
Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. For the task of using Naive Bayes to train the MNIST dataset:
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize the data by transforming pixel values from 0-255 to the range 0-1.
- **Training**: Apply the Naive Bayes algorithm to compute the conditional probabilities of each feature and classify based on these probabilities.

### Pros
- **Simple and Fast**: Naive Bayes is a simple algorithm with fast training speed.
- **Effective with Small Data**: Performs well with small datasets and has good generalization capabilities.
- **Easy to Implement**: Easy to implement and requires minimal computational resources.

### Cons
- **Low Performance on Complex Data**: For complex data with non-linear relationships, Naive Bayes performance is not high.
- **Independence Assumption**: Naive Bayes assumes that features are independent, which is often unrealistic.

## 2. Using Deep Learning to Train the MNIST Dataset with SimpleNN

### Approach
Deep Learning, specifically Simple Neural Network (SimpleNN), is a deep learning method based on artificial neural networks. For the task of using SimpleNN to train the MNIST dataset:
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize the data as in Naive Bayes.
- **Training**: Use a neural network with hidden layers to learn complex features from the data.

### Pros
- **High Performance on Complex Data**: SimpleNN can learn non-linear relationships and complex features from data.
- **Scalability**: Deep Learning can scale to handle large and complex datasets.
- **Flexibility**: The network architecture can be customized to fit specific problems.

### Cons
- **High Resource Requirement**: Requires significant computational resources and longer training time.
- **Difficulty in Tuning**: Selecting hyperparameters and network architecture requires experience and extensive experimentation.
- **Risk of Overfitting**: Deep Learning models are prone to overfitting without proper regularization and careful monitoring.

## Conclusion

Depending on the specific requirements of the task and available resources, the choice between Naive Bayes and SimpleNN can vary. Naive Bayes is suitable for simple tasks with limited resources, while SimpleNN is better suited for complex tasks with large datasets.
